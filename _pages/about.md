I am a final-year PhD candidate in Engineering (Computational Imaging) @ Cambridge, and currently interning @ Apple Research (Cambridge) in the Video Engineering team, where I design and prototype novel algorithms for computational photography using deep learning.

During the course of my PhD, my time was split between the development of advanced optical imaging and spectroscopic techniques (1/3), and novel algorithmic and low-level vision pipelines (2/3) for high-speed scientific imaging of reacting flows (up to 20,000 fps).
