I am a final-year PhD candidate @ Cambridge (Engineering Department), currently wrapping up my internship @ Apple Research (Cambridge). In my internship, I implemented and prototyped novel algorithms for computational photography using deep learning.

During the course of my PhD, my time was split between development of advanced optical imaging and specotroscopic techniques (1/3), and novel algorithmic and low-level vision pipelines (2/3) for high-speed scientific imaging (up to 200,000 fps) of reacting flows at both atmospheric and extreme high-pressure conditions.
